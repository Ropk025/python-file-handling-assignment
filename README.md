  Prompts the user to enter a filename and displays its contents. Handles errors gracefully if the file is missing or unreadable.

- `input.txt` *(optional)*  
  Sample input file for testing `modify_file.py`.

- `output.txt` *(auto-generated)*  
  Contains the modified content after running `modify_file.py`.
